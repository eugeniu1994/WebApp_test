The project consists in two things:

1. creating a simple html interface where the user logs in (name 'user' and password 'password') and upload a csv file 
2. on the backend, the server calls the python script main.py with the input uploaded. The script generates two outputs: a png file and a csv file
3. the user should then see on the html interface the resulted output.csv file (with an hyperlink) and the corresponding png image

To test the script, we have provided an example of input.csv to upload.
and the expected outputs in the expected output folder
